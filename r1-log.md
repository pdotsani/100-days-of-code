## Log

### R1D1
Worked on an udemy course focusing on [React Redux](https://t.co/sqlA0Lh451)

### R1D2
Continued working on the [React Redux](https://t.co/sqlA0Lh451) tutorial. This time, focusing on the package Redux Form.

### R1D3
Continued to work on [React Redux](https://t.co/sqlA0Lh451) course. Almost done!

### R1D4
Finished the section of the [React Redux](https://t.co/sqlA0Lh451) I was working on! Moving onto a side project where I can implement my new skills.

### R1D5
Started a new side project where I will use the marvel API to create an Encyclopedia of heros!

### R1D6
Continuing with the Marvel Encyclopedia. Using the demo app I built in the udemy course as reference, slowly bootstraping my project.

### R1D7
Messing around with lodash. Makes things alot simpler. Believe in abstractions for sure.

### R1D6
Taking the challenges of merging asynchronous calls into redux head on.

### R1D7
Redux is becoming a familiar friend. Must remind myself that the key to async calls functioning sometimes is patience.

### R1D8
Building out tab content. React-Tabs-Redux makes this task simple. Noting like choosing the right library for the job.

### R1D9
Used node-vibrant to extract dominant colors in the hero's image. Made that color the background!

### R1D10
Refined the vibrant functionality by modifing styles on the character info page. Revised logic so page template does not load until charInfo object is complete.

### R1D11
Refined the css on the character page and main page.

### R1D12
Tried to make a component to clean up the code and failed. Left the code the way it was. Added css transtion animation to hover styles.

### R1D13
Experimented with font icons and animations. Refined the searchbar styles.
